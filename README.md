# Instagram-Statistics
A program for anyone curious about their Instagram statistics.

Instructions:
1. Run 'pip install -r requirements.txt'
2. Edit credentials (username, password) in instagram.py
3. Edit target_username in instagram.py
4. Run instagram.py

This program allows you to check:
1. List of users who you follow but are not following back.
2. List of users who are following you but you don't follow back.
3. [Open to suggestions on how you think I can expand this program.]

Do note that:
- Use a throwaway account to avoid suspension as Instagram tracks suspicious log in activity.
- In order to search up users, the target_user must either be a public profile, or the logged in account must be following the target_user.
- If you encounter an error, just log in via the app once for verification.
